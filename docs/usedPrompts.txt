The current react project works great, but it has no CSS styling. Can you make it look more professional without
  changing the functionality? If possible use bulma for styling. bulma.min.css can be found the in the public
  folder. The login page should have its contents centered in the middle but the back to main button should be in
  the top right corner. The landing page should have the login button in the top right corner. If the user managed
  to log in, the login button should display logout instead.

The properties for each event in EventsDisplay are placed horizontally and they do not fit well. Can you place
  them vertically instead?
